Thanks for downloading Z-MERT!!

 (1) What is this?
-------------------

This is the README for Z-MERT (v1.50; released 2/14/11), an open-source tool for
minimum error rate training of machine translation systems.  It is written by
Omar F. Zaidan, a member of the development team for Joshua, an open-source
machine translation system being developed at Johns Hopkins University.  Z-MERT
is Joshua's MERT module, but it is made available as a standalone tool since it
is independent of the internals of the decoder (this is in fact its main
feature).  Z-MERT's webpage is http://cs.jhu.edu/~ozaidan/zmert/.


 (2) Distribution Contents
---------------------------

The distribution consists of the following:

  lib (dir): contains zmert.jar, which basically *is* Z-MERT.
  new_metric_demo (dir): contains documentation on how to implement a new metric
                         in Z-MERT.
  zmert_ex_orig (dir): contains files to be used in Z-MERT's tutorial.
